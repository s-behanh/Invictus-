How to use INVICTUS: 
    Head over to our hosted website by clicking this link: https://invictustwo.azurewebsites.net 
                We have hosted our website using Azure. 

Available features: 
    As of right now, we have the ability to navigate between the different pages. You will see the 5 tabs we have at the top of our website called Login, Home, Map, Profile, and Workouts. When you first open the link, the first page that pops up should be a login page. Right now, we do not have the functionality to login, but we have the page for it. Then, when you click on each tab, it will navigate you to the page. On most of the pages right now, besides login and map, we have a blurb about the pages future functionality.
