# Invictus-

Hello! This is INVICTUS a workout tracking website. This website has been created by Andija Nunn and Hale Behan. 

How to use INVICTUS: 
    Head over to our hosted website by clicking this link: file:///Users/andijanunn/Documents/GitHub/tabs/workouts.html 
                We have hosted our website using Azure. To look on the hosted website, once you click a tab, to go to another, you first must click the back arrow to go back to the page that says "My google maps demo" then click another tab you want to go to.
                
Available features: 
- navigate between 5 different tabs 
- see a fake login page where eventually you will be able to login in to your account
- on the maps page, you will see our google maps API. We tried to have it with a canvas on top of it so that we can click to make points and draw lines on the map, but the two features do not work together. If we turn off the map API, we can draw on the canvas on the website itself. 
- On the workouts page you will see a suggested workout.
