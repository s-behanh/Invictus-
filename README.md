Hello beta testers! 

Thank you so much for agreeing to test our code. We hope to send out bi-weekly code drops fo you to test our code. 

As of now, we have not hosted our website because we feel like we do not have enough code to take on that next step. 

That is however one of our next goals, to be able to get our website hosted. 

Since it is not hosted, we have been running and testing our code on https://jsfiddle.net/ 
This site allows us to be able to run our code. 

When you test our code, this is where you would see how it runs. I have copied it all into there through this link 
https://jsfiddle.net/txpf05m7/1/ 

If this does not work and you have to copy it manualy, you would copy the the corresponding files to the languages on jsfiddle. 
    For example, you would copy the style.css page to the css section of jsfiddle. 

*Note 
We plan on sending another beta test next week once we have implemented a survey into our website that we have been working on. We ran into some problems
trying to do that and wasted a lot of time trying to redo our code last week, and then failed miseraby so we went back to what we 
originally had. We decided to continue working with this code we had before break, and are working quickly to add more dyncamic changes instead of 
restarting like we had tried to do. 

Thank you again for agreeing to be our beta testers, and look out for another drop next week!
