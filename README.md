Hello! This is INVICTUS a workout tracking website. This website has been created by Andija Nunn and Hale Behan. 

How to use INVICTUS: 
    Head over to our hosted website by clicking this link: https://invictustwo.azurewebsites.net 
                We have hosted our website using Azure. 

Available features: 
    As of right now, we have the ability to navigate between the different pages. You will see the 3 tabs we have at the top of our website called Map, Profile, and Workouts. When you first open the link, the first page should say " My Google Maps Demo". Then, when you click on the Map tab, it will say "Invictus". However, when you click Profile and Workouts, it will say "The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.". This is an error that we are attempting to fix.
