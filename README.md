# Invictus-

Hello! This is INVICTUS a workout tracking website. This website has been created by Andija Nunn and Hale Behan. 

How to use INVICTUS: 
    Head over to our hosted website by clicking this link: https://invictustwo.azurewebsites.net 
                We have hosted our website using Azure. To look on the hosted website, once you click a tab, to go to another, you first must click the back arrow to go back to the page that says "My google maps demo" then click another tab you want to go to.
Available features: 
    As of right now, we have the ability to navigate between the different pages. You will see the 5 tabs we have at the top of our website called Login, Home, Map, Profile, and Workouts. The website is hard to use at times but we have a "fake" login page that just can't store any login information then we have pages that have information on future things we want to have on the pages. 
    
    Since we want you guys to fully experience each of our pages, another way to experience the features is through jsfiddle. Below is the steps to view pages in jsfiddle. 
    1. go to the "<> code" page of our github and you should see a folder names "tabs". click on this folder. 
    2. now you should see many pages with names like "home.html" and "profilestyle.css". you will now choose which page you would like to see. You can pick any of the 5: login, home, map, profile, workouts. 
    3. once you pick which page you want to see, go to https://jsfiddle.net/. once you are there, you will go back to github. click on each of the pages for the page you want to see. For example, if you want to see the home page, you will first click "home.html" and copy the code from it. go to jsfiddle and paste that code in to the cooresponding jsfiddle box. the .html code goes in to the html box in jsfiddle. repeat these steps for all of the sub pages for the page you want to see. Do home.css, home.html and homejava.js. some pages do not have javascript (js) so if that is the case leave it blank in jsfiddle. 
    4. enjoy looking at all the pages!
