# Invictus-

Hello! This is INVICTUS a workout tracking website. This website has been created by Andija Nunn and Hale Behan. 

How to use INVICTUS: 
    Unfortunately, although we have made lots of progress for this beta drop including adding our map api, fixing our tabs and updating descriptions and content on the websites, we have not been able to troubleshoot our hosting of the website. 
    
Available features: 
- navigate between 5 different tabs 
- see a fake login page where eventually you will be able to login in to your account
- on the maps page, you will see our google maps API. We tried to have it with a canvas on top of it so that we can click to make points and draw lines on the map, but the two features do not work together. If we turn off the map API, we can draw on the canvas on the website itself. 
                To see the code for the drawing portion, please see in our github the map.html page and you will see the script for it. 
- On the workouts page you will see a suggested workout.
